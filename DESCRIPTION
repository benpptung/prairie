Description: A web framework for R, prairie is based on existing
    frameworks like Express (JS), Django (python), Wookie (lisp), and
    Sinatra (ruby) and provides R users with a set of tools to create
    web applications from scratch. Alternatively, users can coerce and
    combine existing R code and custom classes into responses, routes,
    and applications to serve their code and data across the web.
