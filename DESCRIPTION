Description: A web framework for R, prairie is based on existing 
    frameworks like Express (JS), Django (python), Wookie (lisp), and 
    Sinatra (ruby) and provides R users with a set of tools to create 
    web applications from scratch. Alternatively, users can coerce and 
    combine existing R objects into routes and applications.
