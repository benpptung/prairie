# dull
A light-weight R package for developing modular web applications

The server functionality and setup is primarily based on [expressjs](http://expressjs.com/). The syntactical styling is influenced by [wookie](http://wookie.lyonbros.com/). Additionally, the web frameworks [Sinatra](http://sinatrarb.com/), [Tornado](http://www.tornadoweb.org/en/stable/), [django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) and [Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com/) have also influenced the design of this project. They deserve this mention and more.

I apologize for how sparse this README is. Because I am still ironing out and deciding on the functionality of this package I will update this file at a later date.

Hobey-ho, let's go!
