# dull
A light-weight web server package for R

#### General notes
This project, as stated above, is heavily influenced by expressjs and wookie, but I also want to name Sinatra, Tornado, and Shiny as further web frameworks that have influenced the design choices of this project.

Hobey-ho, let's go!
